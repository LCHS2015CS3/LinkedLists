# LinkedLists
In this assignment, you will complete the "SingleStringList" class to create an implementation of a singly-linked list.
You will need to make yourself a "Node" class to do this, which you should code as a private static inner class, so as to avoid
unnecessary public classes.

You should be able to clone this project directly into NetBeans.
